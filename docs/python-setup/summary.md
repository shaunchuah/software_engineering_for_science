# Summary

Congratulations, you have now covered the basics of Linux, terminals, Python and how to manage Python environments and dependencies.

These topics are basic but absolutely foundational to your journey in software engineering, machine learning, and bioinformatics. You will use these skills every day, so it is important to take your time and understand them well. Understanding these issues will help you achieve reproducibility in your work and make you a more efficient coder.

These skills are also transferable to programming in general and will help you scale up in the cloud. You will be able to run your code on remote servers, manage your dependencies, and run your code in a reproducible manner. You will also be able to debug errors in trying to get your code running on a remote server.
