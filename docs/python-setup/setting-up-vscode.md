# Setting Up VSCode for Python

This is an opinionated guide on setting up Visual Studio Code for Python development. VSCode has a lot to offer for python development, namely due to its support for Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub Copilot.

## Install Visual Studio Code

If you have not already installed Visual Studio Code, you can download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Recommended VSCode Extensions

The following are some of the must-have extensions for Python development in VSCode:

1. **Python**: This is the official Python extension for Visual Studio Code. It provides features such as IntelliSense and more.
2. **Ruff**: Ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/> is a code formatter for Python that integrates with VSCode. You can configure it to automatically format python files upon saving - this helps maintain a consistent python coding style across multiple users.
3. **Jupyter**: This extension provides support for Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code. It allows you to create, edit, run, and debug Jupyter notebooks directly within VSCode.
4. **Data Wrangler**: This extension provides a set of tools for data manipulation and exploration in Visual Studio Code. It includes features like data preview, data transformation, data visualization, and more.
5. **GitHub Copilot**: I found this useful when trying to write code snippets or get the syntax right. It is also good for writing automated tests.
