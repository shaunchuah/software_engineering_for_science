# Section Summary

We have covered the main points of using version control. There are many more advanced features of Git and GitHub which you could explore if and when you need them. For now, this is a good starting point.

You can now create repositories locally and push them up to GitHub. You can subsequently switch to a different machine, clone the repository from GitHub and work on it.

You can also push and pull changes between GitHub and your local repository.
