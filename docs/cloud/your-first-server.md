# Your First Server

We will do this as an interactive session as the interfaces are different for each provider and they change over time. There are a variety of cloud providers including AWS, Azure and DigitalOcean. Let me know your preference for this. DigitalOcean is beginner-friendly, however the powerful machines are on AWS and Azure.

!!! warning
    Remember to shut down your server after this to avoid unnecessary charges.

## What you will need

- Credit card
- Cloud provider account

## Free tiers

Most cloud providers offer a free tier for new users. This is a great way to get started with cloud computing without incurring any costs. The free tier usually includes a limited amount of resources for a limited time period. For example, AWS offers a free tier for 12 months with limited resources.

## Provisioning a server

We will walk you through the process of provisioning a server on a cloud provider.

1. Sign in to your cloud provider account.
2. Navigate to the dashboard.
3. Click on the `Create Instance` or `Create Server` button.
4. Choose the operating system you want to use. We recommend using Ubuntu as it is the most popular choice.
5. Choose the server size. The free tier usually offers a small server with 1 CPU and 1GB of RAM.
6. Ensure the server location is set to the UK.
7. Choose the SSH key. You can use an existing SSH key or create a new one. We recommend creating a new SSH key for each server.
8. Click on the `Create` button.
