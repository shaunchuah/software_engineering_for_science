# Introduction to the Cloud

The cloud is a term that refers to a network of remote servers that are hosted on the internet and was really pioneered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). When Amazon first started out selling books, they had to build a network of servers and realised that they had a lot of excess capacity. They then decided to rent out this excess capacity to other companies, and this is how AWS was born. These servers are used to store, manage, and process data, rather than using a local server or a personal computer. Today the three major players are AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. However, there are smaller cloud providers as well, such as DigitalOcean and Linode.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Cloud computing allows organizations to access and use these services on an as-needed basis, without the need to invest in and maintain their own infrastructure.

There are three main types of cloud services:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. This includes servers (also called compute), storage, and networking.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. For example, managed databases.

3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides software applications that are hosted in the cloud and accessed over the internet. Users can access these applications through a web browser. Examples include gmail, office 365.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

There are several benefits to using cloud computing:

1. Scalability: Cloud services can be scaled up or down based on demand. This allows organizations to quickly adjust their computing resources to meet changing needs.

2. Flexibility: Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

3. Cost Savings: Cloud computing eliminates the need to invest in and maintain physical infrastructure. Cloud services charge on a pay-as-you-go basis.

4. Security: Cloud providers invest in security measures to protect data and infrastructure. This is helpful for small teams that may not have the resources to invest in security - for example, regularly patching servers.

## For Scientists and Researchers

Cloud computing is very useful when we need to process large datasets, especially as this is often only done occasionally. Computers are like cars, they depreciate over time and are most often idle. Cloud computing allows us to rent a powerful computer for a short period of time to process our data. It also lets us use newer hardware such as access to the latest GPUs.

For an individual, being able to leverage the cloud means that you can run your analysis on a powerful machine without needing to own one. This can be especially useful when you are working with large datasets that require a lot of computational power. This is an essential skill that will be useful in your career.
