## Hello World

Now that we have covered the foundational topics earlier on, let's dive into your first python program.

First, let's create a directory. You can name it anything you want. For this tutorial, we will name it `python-tutorial`.

I tend to keep all my programming projects in `~/Developer/`. I suggest you group all your coding projects into a single directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Developer/python-tutorial
cd ~/Developer/python-tutorial
```

You can open this directory in VSCode by running the following command:

```bash
code .
```

Next, create a file named `hello.py` and open it in your favorite text editor.

```python title="hello.py"
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run this program, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then run the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have just written your first Python program. ðŸŽ‰
