# Software Engineering for Biological Science (Zero to Hero)

This course is designed for individuals with zero coding experience and provides a focused overview of key software engineering topics relevant to bioinformatics and machine-learning/AI workflows.

It is designed to complement existing bioinformatics courses which have a focus on processing biological datasets, for example using R and Seurat for single-cell sequencing data.

This course is a roadmap and not an exhaustive resource. It highlights the key topics that you need to be familiar with and points you towards further resources for deeper learning.

## Course Objectives

This course aims to equip you with a solid foundation in:

1. Coding practices
2. Basics of servers and cloud computing
3. Containerization

so that you can:

1. Manage your code effectively
2. Process large datasets
3. Scale up your computational power
4. Reproduce every step of your analysis

## Why Focus on Python?

While both R and Python offer unique advantages, proficiency in both languages is beneficial. However, this course will focus on Python for the following reasons:

- Extensive Ecosystem: Python has a robust ecosystem of machine learning and AI software packages.
- Mature Tooling: Python's language tools are more advanced compared to R.
- Ease of Production: It's easier to productionize code in Python.
- Cloud Integration: Python can interact seamlessly with cloud services.
- Existing Coverage: Many bioinformatics courses already cover R.
- Support Availability: Python is well-supported by tools like ChatGPT/LLMs due to the abundance of Python code available online.

## Feedback

One of the difficulties in creating material for beginners is the curse of knowledge - the inability to remember what it was like to not know something. I would appreciate any feedback on the course material, especially if you are a beginner and find something difficult to understand or there is a gap in the explanations. Let me know and I will improve the material based on your feedback.
