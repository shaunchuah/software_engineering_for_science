# Welcome to Software Engineering for Biological Science

This course is designed for individuals with zero coding experience and provides a comprehensive introduction to key software engineering topics relevant to scientific workflows. It is designed to complement existing bioinformatics courses which have a focus on processing biological datasets, for example using R and Seurat.

This course will cover the basics needed to start exploring machine learning techniques and applying it to the output of biological datasets that have been processed through bioinformatics pipelines.

This course will also cover the basics of cloud computing and how to run your code on large clusters of remote servers. This is important as the datasets we are working with are getting larger and larger and it is increasingly difficult to run these on your local machine.

## Course Objectives

- Introduction to key software engineering principles
- Familiarise learners with the terminal and basic commands to control remote servers
- Equip learners with the ability to collaborate with others
- Understand how to achieve reproducibility in computational workflows
- Learn how to manage dependencies and environments
- Introduction to containerization
- Equip learners with the ability to process big data in the cloud

## Why Focus on Python?

While both R and Python offer unique advantages, proficiency in both languages is beneficial. However, this course will focus on Python for the following reasons:

- Extensive Ecosystem: Python has a robust ecosystem of machine learning and AI software packages.
- Mature Tooling: Python's language tools are more advanced compared to R.
- Ease of Production: It's easier to productionize code in Python.
- Cloud Integration: Python can interact seamlessly with cloud services.
- Existing Coverage: Many bioinformatics courses already cover R.
- Support Availability: Python is well-supported by tools like ChatGPT/LLMs due to the abundance of Python code available online.

## Feedback

One of the difficulties in creating material for beginners is the curse of knowledge - the inability to remember what it was like to not know something. I would appreciate any feedback on the course material, especially if you are a beginner and find something difficult to understand or there is a gap in the explanations. Let me know and I will improve the material based on your feedback.
